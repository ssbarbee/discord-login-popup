# Discord Login Popup

The `discord-login-popup` repository offers a streamlined solution for integrating Discord OAuth2 authentication into web applications. This library facilitates user login through a popup window, simplifying the process of obtaining user information and access tokens from Discord's API. The implementation is designed for ease of use, making it an ideal choice for developers who need to add Discord authentication with minimal setup.

## Features

- **Easy Integration**: Quickly add Discord OAuth2 login to your web application.
- **Customizable**: Configure client ID, redirect URI, and scope settings to tailor the authentication flow.
- **Token Management**: Simplifies the process of retrieving and managing Discord access tokens.
- **User Information**: Effortlessly obtain user information from Discord after authentication.

## Installation

To install the `discord-login-popup` library, you can use npm or yarn:

```bash
# Using npm
npm install discord-login-popup

# Using yarn
yarn add discord-login-popup
```

# Usage
Idea: Open a popup window with the discord login page. 
The popup window will open and close automatically upon login. 
After login, the popup window will close and the token will be passed to the parent window.

As integrator, you need to provide the client id, redirect url, and scopes.
You also need to provide a callback function that will be called when the popup window is closed.

You must host a page that will open the popup window. This page must inject the [discord-login-token-detector.js](https://github.com/ssbarbee/discord-login-popup/blob/main/static/discord-login-token-detector.js) script from this repository.
Feel free to download the script and host it yourself. Example: [discord-login.html](https://github.com/ssbarbee/discord-login-popup/blob/main/static/discord-login.html)

Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to use the discord-login-popup library:

```typescript
import { discordLoginPopup } from 'discord-login-popup';

// Get your client ID from the Discord Developer Portal
// https://discord.com/developers/applications
const clientId = 'YOUR_DISCORD_CLIENT_ID';
// Redirect URL must be the same as the one you set in the Discord Developer Portal
// This is the URL for a page that will open in the popup. This page must inject the `static/discord-login-token-detector.js` script from this repository
// Checkout the static/discord-login.html file for an example of how to use this page
const redirectUri = 'YOUR_REDIRECT_URI';
const scopes = 'identify';

const login = () => {
    discordLoginPopup({
        discordAppClientId: clientId,
        redirectUrl: redirectUri,
        scopes: scopes,
        onStart: () => console.log('Login started'),
        onError: (error) => console.error('Login failed', error),
        onSuccess: (data) => console.log('Login successful', data),
        onClose: () => console.log('Popup closed'),
    });
};

// Call the login function on a button click or any other event
login();
```

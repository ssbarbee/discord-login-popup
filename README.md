# Usage üéâ 

## Requirements üéì

Open a popup window with the discord login page. Upon login, the popup window will close and the token will be passed to the parent window.

## Steps üõ†Ô∏è

1) As integrator, you need to provide the client id, redirect url, and scopes. Make sure to obtain a client id from the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

2) You also need to provide a callback function that will be called when the discord login popup is closed and the token is passed to the parent window.

3) You must host a page that will open inside popup window after discord redirect. This page must inject the [discord-login-token-detector.js](https://github.com/ssbarbee/discord-login-popup/blob/main/static/discord-login-token-detector.js) script from this repository.
Feel free to download the script and host it yourself. Example: [discord-login.html](https://github.com/ssbarbee/discord-login-popup/blob/main/static/discord-login.html)

## Usage in Typescript üì¶

Here‚Äôs a basic example of how to use the `discord-login-popup` package in a React application:

```typescript
import { discordLoginPopup, OnSuccessTokenParams } from 'discord-login-popup';

// Get your client ID from the Discord Developer Portal
// https://discord.com/developers/applications
const clientId = 'YOUR_DISCORD_CLIENT_ID';
// Redirect URL must be the same as the one you set in the Discord Developer Portal
// This is the URL for a page that will open in the popup. This page must inject the `static/discord-login-token-detector.js` script from this repository
// Checkout the static/discord-login.html file for an example of how to use this page
const redirectUri = 'YOUR_REDIRECT_URI';
const scopes = 'identify';
// The response type can be either 'token' or 'code'
// If you choose 'token', the popup will return the access token
// If you choose 'code', the popup will return the code
// Make sure you cast the data to the correct type OnSuccessTokenParams or OnSuccessCodeParams
const responseType = 'token';

const login = () => {
    discordLoginPopup({
        discordAppClientId: clientId,
        redirectUrl: redirectUri,
        scopes: scopes,
        responseType: responseType,
        onStart: () => console.log('Login started'),
        onError: (data) => console.error('Login failed. Reason:', data.error_description, data.error),
        onSuccess: (data) => console.log('Login successful. Data:', data as OnSuccessTokenParams),
        onClose: () => console.log('Popup closed'),
    });
};

// Call the login function on a button click or any other event
login();
```
